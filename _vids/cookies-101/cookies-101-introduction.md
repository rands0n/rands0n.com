Have you ever asked yourself why some websites ask your permission to store cookies on your machine? Some of them allow us to choose which type of cookies we allow them to save.

Cookies are useful for many things on the internet. They enable web servers to store stateful information(such as items added in a shopping online store) or store user information. There are many types of cookies available.

For example, we can use an authentication cookie  to store information about a user that is logged in, in our website. We also can use tracking cookie to access our browser history.

We’re gonna discuss the terminology of cookies. For example, we have: session cookie, persistent cookie, secure cookie, http-only cookie, same-site cookie, third-party cookie, supercookie. And last, but not least, a cookie wall. We’re gonna see all these types.

Also, we’re gonna look how we structure a cookie.  We need to define some fields for that, for example a domain, the name of the cookie, the value associated with that name. If the cookie is secure or not.

Hope you enjoy the series.
